Related Libraries
------------------

For the 2.x branch of Drupal Commerce, Commerce Guys has moved some of the logic
out of the Drupal world and into the greater PHP community. This effort has
produced three unique eCommerce-related PHP libraries (please star on github):

###[Address](https://github.com/commerceguys/address)

This library manipulates postal addresses, more precisely the kind of postal
addresses meant to identify a precise recipient location for shipping purposes.

###[Pricing](https://github.com/commerceguys/pricing)

A component for managing prices, taxes, discounts, fees.

###[Zone](https://github.com/commerceguys/zone)

Zone checks if an address matches a set of conditions.
